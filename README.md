# imBoredEngine - Vrglab
I was bored, so I started making another iteration of my Making a GameEngine Project.

### What can this shit do ?
This is a java based engine so it's Not like a Engine that is written in C++ and is Cross-Platforms

But here is what can do and what I want it to do:
1. Lua Scripting
2. 3D - 2D Graphics
3. Resource Management
4. Basic Threading
5. Custom Game Builder
6. Awsome .Vibe (Vrglab’s Im Bored Engine) files - engine’s custom binary game format
